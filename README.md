    monday: [
      { start: "10:00", end: "13:00" },
      { start: "15:00", end: "18:00" }
    ]
  }
});

console.log(store.opened());
```

### Example 2: adding exceptional closings dates

```javascript

      { start: "10:00", end: "13:00" },
      { start: "15:00", end: "18:00" }
    ]
  }
});

if (store.opened()) {
  console.log("closes in", store.closeIn());
} else {
  console.log(store.availability());
}
```

### Example 6: get the store closes in as a date

```javascript
const OpenedClosed = require("opened-closed");

const store = new OpenedClosed({
  timezone: "GMT+0100",
  openings: {
    wednesday: [{ start: "10:00", end: "19:00" }]
  }
});

if (store.opened()) {
  const closeAt = store.closeAt().toLocaleString(); // Maybe GMT+01 is not yours, so LocalString take care of it.

} else {
  console.log(store.availability()); // "closed"
}
```

## Contributing

- The code is located in `src/main.ts`. This is in TypeScript, but it also support plain JavaScript if you prefer.
- I prefer no dependencies for the moment, because this is help making a working web solution (opened to suggestions to improve the workflow).
- The web solution is simply removing the export statement, and using Gulp to transpile TypeScript in ES5 (opened to suggestions to improve the workflow).

1. Create an issue
2. Create a branche with the number of the issue in it: `git checkout -b issue-36`
3. Create tests inside `test/`
4. Light on dev: `npm run dev`
5. Make your changes on `src/main.ts`
6. Run test using `npm run test`
7. Copy `main.ts` in `opened-closed.ts`, remove the `export = OpenedClosed;` line
8. Run `npm run prod`
9. Create a Pull Request from your branch to master

Thank you for your time!
